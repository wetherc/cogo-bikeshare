    "# Analysis overview\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, we're looking at rider volume of COGO bikeshare bikes. The plan of analysis I'm taking is to view this almost as a queueing problem, and to simulate inbound and outbound volume at each station over some arbitrary time period, and with respect to the simultaneous activity at every other station. Ultimately, I'm interested in identifying stations that can become bottlenecks, either by virtue of having no remaining bikes to lend, or having no available docks to which to return a bike. I chose this approach for several reasons:\n",
    "  - Predicting overall ridership volume, and forecasting out to some future point, is a relatively straightforward problem. I assume it has already been solved.\n",
    "  - Predicting ridership volume on a per-station basis is only marginally useful: this type of analysis is likely to ignore the fact that we are dealing with a closed system in which there are a limited and pre-determined number of bikes available, of which only a subset can be rented out from a given station at any given time. Any model that is agnostic to the capacity of a given station, or to the volume of inbound traffic it receives, is not liable to provide useful or actionable predictions. (E.g., if we predict that a 15-dock station will have 30 departures over the course of an hour, how can we respond? Do we double the capacity of the station? Do we send a van to fill any empty docks? Will the inbound volume over that time period be enough to meet the demand without any intervention?)\n",
    "  - Treating this as a queueing problem allows us to integrate both seasonal changes in departure volume (hourly, daily, monthly â€” although this implementation only looks at ridership on an hourly basis) and a transition matrix of probabilities that a prototypical rider will transit from any station `N` to any other station `M`. This specifically solves for the fact that we are operating in a closed system with a limited number of bikes, each station having access only to an even more limited subset thereof at any given point in time. It also gives us the ability to easily take action based on simulations we run: we can easily flag cases where a station is about to run out of either available bikes or free docks, allowing us to move bikes from overfull stations to underfull ones.\n",
    "  \n",
    "# Exploring the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I'm just going to overlay the stations with their cumulative lifetime arrival and departure counts onto a map of downtown Columbus. If we wanted to tweak this to help intuit what our later simulations might tell us, we could look at these data on the basis of average daily arrivals, departures, and net change: this might help visually identify which stations were net consumers of or producers of bikes, and would need to be manually re-balanced more frequently. But for my purposes here, just getting a sense of where everything is geographically is enough for right now."
